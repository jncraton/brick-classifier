Brick Classifier
================

[Demo](https://brick-classifier.netlify.app)

A LEGO brick classifer using a fine-tuned squeezenet and ONNX JS runtime.

TODO
----

- Add renders for additional classes
- Attempt only including renders from angles that make it possible to positively identify the brick (e.g. all 1xn bricks look the same from the end)
